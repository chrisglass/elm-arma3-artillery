An arma3 artillery computer written in Elm
===========================================

This project is an artillery calculator for arma3 written in Elm.

Why?
----

Because some servers disallow the in-game computer and calculating ballistics
by hand is a pain in the ass.

Why Elm?
---------

Because I wanted to try Elm, and it turns out to be well suited for this type
of low-state projects!

I want to contribute!
---------------------

It's just a toy project, feel free to fork. Otherwise, go play some Arma3 :)
